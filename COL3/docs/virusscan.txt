==================
Virus scan support
==================

COL3 provides support for virus scanning through the script at
"COL3/Extensions/virusscan.py". It can be invoked in 2 ways.

Scan preparation
================

If you call it like::

 bin/instance1 run src/Products/COL3/Extensions/virusscan.py ConserveOnline prepare [scandir]

It will generate a structure for virus scaning on "scandir" if provided. If not
provided, "scandir" defaults to a directory on the temporary directory location
configured for Zope, with a name corresponding to the date of the scan. In any
case the directory name will be reported back by the script.

This directory structure will contain a "MANIFEST" file on the top-level, and
a directory structure mirroring the content structure of the site, with files
at the ends of these structures.

A virus scan is supposed to run through this structure and *remove* all files
it deems to be infected.

Notice that "scandir" MUST be in the same partition as the blob storage is
configured. This is the default if "scandir" is not provided, as configured by
default by buildout.

Scan reporting
==============

If you call the script like

 bin/instance1 run src/Products/COL3/Extensions/virusscan.py ConserveOnline report <scandir>

The script will analise the manifest file and report whether the content has
been modified since the scan preparation, or whether it was deemed infected
by the virus scan. This latter situation is detected by the absence of the
equivalent file from the scan structure.

The report will be placed at the top-level of the scan structure, in a file
called "report.txt".
