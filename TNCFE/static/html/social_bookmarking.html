                    <strong>Q: What are all these icons?</strong><br />
                    A: They're links to social bookmarking sites.

                    <strong>Q: What's "social bookmarking?"</strong><br />
                    A: Social bookmarking means that you're storing your bookmarks online, rather than on your web browser. This lets you share cool things you read with others.

                <li style="margin-bottom:6px; list-style:none;">
                    <strong>Q: How do I access my bookmarks if they're on the internet, and not on my computer?</strong><br />
                    A: Instead of appearing on your browser toolbar, your bookmarks will appear on a website. They'll be available to you as long as you can get online -- which is the only time you need your bookmarks anyway, right?
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom:6px; list-style:none;">
                    <strong>Q: Why should I share my bookmarks with other people?</strong><br />
                    A: Scanning other other peoples' bookmarks is a great way to find new and interesting information. Think of it as a kind of word of mouth recommendation from one of your friends. It's like saying, "I think this is worth reading. Check it out."

                <li style="margin-bottom:6px;list-style:none;"><strong> Q: Why are there so many different kinds of social bookmarking sites?</strong><br />
                    A: Social networking tools are relatively new, which means that there are lots and lots of competing services. They all have their own unique communities and features. Try looking at a few to find out which you'd like to use.
