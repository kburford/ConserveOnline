    <h1>What are "Keywords"?</h1>
    <p>Keywords are a way of organizing the pages and files in your workspace according to their
        topic. Keywords have replaced folders for organizing pages and files in ConserveOnline 3.0.</p>

    <p>In a workspace, when you click on "Files &amp; Pages" in the left menu, you see the index of
        files &amp; pages organized by keyword. Each file and page has its own keyword. These keywords are created
        when authors add a keyword to a file or page. They can either choose from an existing keyword or
        type in a new keyword. As such, keyword act as a filing system for workspace files &amp; pages.</p>

    <p>Whenever you add a file or page to the workspace, you are required to select at least one
        keyword to describe it. The keywords you choose are where you will look in the index of
        files &amp; pages to find that page or file again.</p>

    <p>If you choose more than one keyword, the page or file will be categorized under all of those
        keywords in the index of files &amp; pages. However, the first keyword you choose is the primary keyword,
        and it will affect how the page or file is found in searches.</p>
    
    <p>Enter only one keyword per input box.  For example, an input box with several words or 
        phrases separated by commas is treated as one keyword.</p>
