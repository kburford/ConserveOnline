    <p>Biogeographic Regions are characterized by the evolutionary history of the plants and animals they contain.</p>
    <p>The specific regions you may choose from are:</p>
     <p><u>Afrotropic:</u> Most of the Afrotropic, with the exception of Africa's southern tip, has a tropical climate.</p>
     <p><u>Australasia:</u> Includes Australia , the island of New Guinea (including Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian province of Papua), and the eastern part of the Indonesian archipelago, including the island of Sulawesi, the Moluccan islands (the Indonesian provinces of Maluku and North Maluku ) and islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, Sumba, Flores, and Timor, often known as the Lesser Sundas</p>
	<p><u>Indo-Malay:</u> It extends across most of South and Southeast Asia and into the southern parts of East Asia.</p>
    <p><u>Nearctic:</u> The Nearctic covers most of North America, including Greenland and the highlands of Mexico.</p>
    <p><u>Neotropics:</u> This includes South and Central America, the Mexican lowlands, the Caribbean islands, and southern Florida, because these regions share a large number of plant and animal groups.</p>
    <p><u>Oceania:</u>  The ecozone includes the Pacific Ocean islands of Micronesia, the Fijian Islands, and most of Polynesia (with the exception of New Zealand). New Zealand and most of Melanesia, including New Guinea, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and New Caledonia, are included, with Australia in the Australasia region, not including any land masses.</p>
