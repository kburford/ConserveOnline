   <h1>What are Creative Commons Licenses?</h1>
   <p>When you contribute content to ConserveOnline, you as the author need to choose the terms you
    are contributing the information. More specifically, the license for the content.</p>
   <p>ConserveOnline is committed to a "conservation commons". This means information that is
    freely available without restrictive terms and conditions. Thus, we have chosen a number of
    licenses from the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> project's <a
     href="http://creativecommons.org/about/license/">set of licenses:</a></p>

   <h2>Attribution No Derivatives (by-nd)</h2>
   <div><em>Note: This is the default license.</em></div>
   
   <p>This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed
    along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you. </p>
   

   <h2>Attribution (by)</h2>

   <p>This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even
    commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most
    accommodating of licenses offered, in terms of what others can do with your works licensed under
    Attribution. </p>
   <h2>Attribution Share Alike (by-sa)</h2>

   <p>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial reasons,
    as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. This
    license is often compared to open source software licenses. All new works based on yours will
    carry the same license, so any derivatives will also allow commercial use. </p>
   <h2>Attribution Non-commercial (by-nc)</h2>

   <p>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although
    their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don't have to license
    their derivative works on the same terms. </p>

   <h2>Attribution Non-commercial Share Alike (by-nc-sa)</h2>

   <p>This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as
    they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. Others can download
    and redistribute your work just like the by-nc-nd license, but they can also translate, make
    remixes, and produce new stories based on your work. All new work based on yours will carry the
    same license, so any derivatives will also be non-commercial in nature. </p>
   <h2>Attribution Non-commercial No Derivatives (by-nc-nd)</h2>

   <p>This license is the most restrictive of our six main licenses, allowing redistribution. This
    license is often called the "free advertising" license because it allows others to download your
    works and share them with others as long as they mention you and link back to you, but they
    can't change them in any way or use them commercially. </p>
